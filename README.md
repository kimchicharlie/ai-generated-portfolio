# Charlie Henin - Professional Portfolio

This project is my upgraded resume website, built as the next step after my previous [portfolio](https://github.com/kimchicharlie/portfolio).

My previous site was starting to feel outdated, so I set out to build a more modern version‚Äîtailored to the North American resume style, powered by newer technologies, and created as an experiment in AI-assisted development.

One of my goals was to see how far I could go without writing much code myself. Using Cursor (claude-4-sonnet), I explored the limits of AI-assisted development.

The result is a modern, responsive website powered by:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

I also added a small memory game so visitors can get to know me in a more interactive way!
